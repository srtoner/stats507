# # Question 0: Pandas Topics: Window Functions
#
# Of the many funcitons in Pandas, one which is particularly useful for time
# series analysis is the window function. It lets us apply some aggregation 
# function over a specified lookback period on a rolling basis throughout the
# time series. This is particularly useful for financial analsyis of equity
# returns, so we will compute some financial metrics for Amazon stock using
# this techinique.

# Our first step is to import our data for Amazon ("AMZN") 
# over a healthy time horizon:

# +
amzn_data = web.DataReader("AMZN", 
                           data_source = 'yahoo', 
                           start = "2016-10-01", 
                           end = "2021-10-01")

amzn_data.head()

# While the column labels are largely self-explanatory, two important notes
# should be made:
# * The adjusted close represents the closing price after all is said and done
# after the trading session ends; this may represent changes due to accounts 
# being settled / netted against each other, or from adjustments to financial
# reporting statements.
# * One reason for our choice in AMZN stock rather than others is that AMZN
# has not had a stock split in the last 20 years; for this reason we do not
# need to concern ourselves with adjusting for the issuance of new shares like
# we would for TSLA, AAPL, or other companies with large
# market capitalization.

# Getting back to Pandas, we have three main functions that allow us to
# perform Window operations:
# * `df.shift()`: Not technically a window operation, but helpful for
# computing calculations with offsets in time series
# * `rolling`: For a given fixed lookback period, tells us the 
# aggregation metric (mean, avg, std dev)
# * `expanding`: Similar to `rolling`, but the lookback period is not fixed. 
# Helpful when we want to have a variable lookback period such as "month to 
# date" returns

# Two metrics that are often of interest to investors are the returns of an
# asset and the volume of shares traded. Returns are either calculated on
# a simple basis:
# $$ R_s = P_1/P_0 -1$$
# or a log basis:
# $$ R_l = \log (P_1 / P_2) $$
# Simple returns are more useful when aggregating returns across multiple 
# assets, while Log returns are more flexible when looking at returns across 
# time. As we are just looking at AMZN, we will calculate the log returns
# using the `shift` function:

#+ 
amzn_data["l_returns"] = np.log(amzn_data["Adj Close"]/
                                amzn_data["Adj Close"].shift(1))


plt.title("Log Returns of AMZN")
plt.plot(amzn_data['l_returns'])

# -

# For the latter, we see that the
# volume of AMZN stock traded is quite noisy:

# +
plt.title("Daily Trading Volume of AMZN")   
plt.plot(amzn_data['Volume'])
# -

# If we want to get a better picture of the trends, we can always take a
# moving average of the last 5 days (last full set of trading days):

# +    
amzn_data["vol_5dma"] = amzn_data["Volume"].rolling(window = 5).mean()
plt.title("Daily Trading Volume of AMZN")   
plt.plot(amzn_data['vol_5dma'])
# -

# When we apply this to a price metric, we can identify some technical patterns
# such as when the 15 or 50 day moving average crosses the 100 or 200 day
# moving average (known as the golden cross, by those who believe in it).

# + 
amzn_data["ma_15"] = amzn_data["Adj Close"].rolling(window = 15).mean()
amzn_data["ma_100"] = amzn_data["Adj Close"].rolling(window = 100).mean()

fig1 = plt.figure()
plt.plot(amzn_data["ma_15"])
plt.plot(amzn_data["ma_100"])
plt.title("15 Day MA vs. 100 Day MA")

# We can then use the `shift()` method to identify which dates have 
# golden crosses

gc_days = (amzn_data.eval("ma_15 > ma_100") & 
               amzn_data.shift(1).eval("ma_15 <= ma_100"))

gc_prices = amzn_data["ma_15"][gc_days]


fig2 = plt.figure()
plt.plot(amzn_data["Adj Close"], color = "black")
plt.scatter( x= gc_prices.index, 
                y = gc_prices[:],
                marker = "+", 
                color = "gold" 
                )

plt.title("Golden Crosses & Adj Close")

# The last feature that Pandas offers is a the `expanding` window function, 
# which calculates a metric over a time frame that grows with each additional 
# period. This is particularly useful for backtesting financial metrics
# as indicators of changes in equity prices: because one must be careful not
# to apply information from the future when performing backtesting, the 
# `expanding` functionality helps ensure we only use information up until the 
# given point in time. Below, we use the expanding function to plot cumulative
# return of AMZN over the time horizon.
